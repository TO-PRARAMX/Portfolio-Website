# PLANCKS 2025: More Than Just My First Trip in Europe

This was a story about me and my friend going to Barcelona, Spain for the Physics League Across Numerous Countries for Kick-ass Students (PLANCKS) 2025. I want to recap my journey before, during, and after getting to PLANCKS to share my experience and insight, as well as to remind me not to forget this invaluable moment.

PLANCKS is an exam-based physics competition for university students, bachelor's and master's. The participants compete in team of three to four people, and they will solve the challanging theoretical questions, normally 10 questions in total (this year has 9 questions, though). However, what participants are really expecting from this event are to connect with other people, to discover career and research opportunities as physicists, and to just have fun.

## Beginning of Everything

First time I knew about PLANCKS is quite straightforward, university email. I happened to be very fortunate to know other IPhO medalists, so we just teamed up together since we know that the contents in the competition is undergraduate, very advanced compared to range of knowledge we learned from Olympiad in high school.

As we learned that NUS sponsored the selected team, realizing if we manage to get the spot, it's a free trip, my team made an appointment to solve past year exams together. We found some study rooms and had snacks together while solving few exams. One nice thing about it is that we will equally split the questions to each individual, and we will take turn showing solution, or discussing in a case that no one can completely finish the problem. Don't get me wrong, we're not tryharder or anything, it just happens that all of us are really physics enthusiasts (I know some of you reader will still tease me like that lol).

Trivia: regarding the team name, we were discussing for few days, and our final name was "On the spectrum", proposed by a Ukraining guy. LOL. It's also kinda hilarious that my team consists of one Singaporean (Hui Xiang), one Malaysian (Kian Yau Chang), one Ukrainian (Yaroslave Kondrachuk), and one Thai (me).

## Preliminary Round: A Delightful Surprise

Each member country sends 1 to 2 team (except the UK and Ireland which they combine together and send 3 teams). A decision will depend on local organization committee responsible for preliminary round. In Singapore, it is undertaken by Institute of Physics Singapore - Students Chapter (IPSSC). They are responsible for hosting an event and making the exam. Some former PLANCKS delegate are in part of this committee.

PLANCKS 2025 Preliminary spanned 3 days. The first day is an opening and a workshop. The second day is mostly the competition, and the last day is excursion, special lecture, and closing ceremony.

### First Day

There's nothing much about opening ceremony. I only remember a workshop afterwards. The workshop was run by a professor from NTU. To be honest, it's not really a workshop, but rather it's just another special. The content was interesting, though. It was about robotics arm and SE(3) transformation group. I understanded most parts at the beginning, but then he proceed to introduces some whacked terminology like lie algebra and exponential map, blah, blah, blah. It was the moment when my monkey year 1 student brain cannot handle those jargons. On the bright side, it was the first time I learned that classical physics can get reallyyy abstract and can be connected to advnace mathematics topics, such as group theory.

### Second Day

There was a free lunch before the examination (it was quite ok). Due to limitation of available spaces in NUS at the moment(always occupied with stuff, typical NUS), the venue have to be divided to 2 bulidings. My team went to central libary. It was a bit dissappoiting that we didn't have whiteboard, when teams that went to science building can enjoy a spacious whiteboard.

Anyway, it was really fun experience. Unlike Physics Olympiad, you are allowed to talk and discuss to your teammate, and frankly it's not a speed test. Many Physics Olympiad problems can be brain teaser sometimes, but for PLANKCS'sh exam, you mostly just need to know advanced stuffs taught in maybe year 3-4, so we are quite in disadvantage, in a sense that we are only year 1 students (one year two student).

This was our game plan, as we agree upon training: Hui Xiang dealt with problems that is actually tricky becuase he's smart. I did thermodynamics and modern physics, Yaroslave solves electomagnetism and optics, and Chang solve astrophysics and remaining problems that remained.

### Last Day

As far as I remember, there was a tour to quantum computer in CQT, where currently it's mostly superconducting qubit. Basically superconducting qubit is basically electron in quantum harmonic oscillator, and you kinda make of perturbation to the system in such a way that the second exicited and higher states barely couple with two desired states: the ground and the first excited states. Then I got to see the shape of the acutal quantum chip.

Later, there was a session of NUS professor giving a lecture of fractional quantum hall effect. I didn't really understand much and didn't give attention as a result.

Then there's the most anticipated session, the closing and result annoucement. Before they annouced the result, we kind of already knew that we're very likely to get 2nd place, because prosepctive first place are all year 3 and 4 physics student. 

We got 2nd place, earning $200 prize cash. We were really content with result, although we moved on quickly and just continue (our) normal life, misunderstanding that there will be only 1 team from Singapore to participate in PLANCKS final. My fate flipped like up-side-down when the organizer sent an email 1 months later that 2 team from Singapore would participate to PLANCKs 2025, in Barcelona, Spain. 


## VISA Application: Reality

Unlike any Olympiad I had during high school, it's the first time I have to deal. As the only member without free Visa

## In Spain

### Day 1

### Day 2

### Day 3

### Day 4

### Day 5

### Day 6

You might expect that people tried really hard to perform as best as possible, but
